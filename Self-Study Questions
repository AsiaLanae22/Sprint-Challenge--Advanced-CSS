What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

Usually default font-size of the browser is 16px. Setting font-size: 100% will make 1rem = 16px. But it will make 
calculations a little difficult. A better way is to set font-size: 62.5%. Because 62.5% of 16px is 10px. Which makes 1rem = 10px.
